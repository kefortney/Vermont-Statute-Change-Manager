              <p>Prior to appointing an assessor, the selectboard shall appoint a committee, composed of three members of the selectboard and four residents of the town of Berlin, to review and recommend to the selectboard qualified candidates for the position of assessor.

Upon completion of the investigation and interviewing of candidates, the committee shall submit to the selectboard the names of those candidates deemed qualified for the position of assessor. The selectboard shall appoint an assessor from among those deemed qualified by the committee. In the event that the committee does not submit at least three qualified candidates to the selectboard, the selectboard shall either appoint an assessor from among the qualified candidates or notify the committee, in writing, that none of the candidates shall be appointed. The committee shall then reconvene and submit the names of additional qualified candidates to the selectboard.</p>
